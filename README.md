# predicting_profit_of_a_company_with_Linear_regression.
A linear regression was used to predict the profit of a company based on certain conditioning factors such as R&D spend, Admnistration, Marketing Spend and State. 
Necessary packages and modules were installed. Data visualization was done using heatmap from seaborn module.
The data was splitted into training and testing data and a linear regression model was built.
